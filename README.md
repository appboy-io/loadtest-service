# mongoSpringDataExample
Example code for future project

# Running this project
This project can be run just like any other spring-boot project with maven
command: 'mvn spring-boot:run'

- Also, I am using Lombrok to handle Setters/Getters/ToString implementations. You'll need a plugin to support this.
- Lastly, this project is using an embedded MongoDB.
